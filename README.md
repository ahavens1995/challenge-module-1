# Havens Semantic Mockup
## Description
The first coding challenge of our bootcamp was to take a prebuilt webpage and replace the div tags with HTML semantic elements.
This was done to gain a better understanding of a more readable website. 
By doing this, I better understand how semantic elements tie into an HTML file and make the file readable.
